# User Story Engineer - Long-term Memory

## Session 2026-02-25

### Task Completed

- Issue #942: Add JSDoc comments to exported types
- PR: https://github.com/cpa03/blueprintify/pull/998

### Approach

1. Checked for existing user-story-engineer PRs - none found
2. Reviewed open issues to find small, well-scoped improvements
3. Selected Issue #942 (JSDoc comments) as appropriate for domain
4. Implemented changes to packages/shared/src/types.ts
5. Verified with typecheck, lint, build
6. Created PR with user-story-engineer label

### Lessons Learned

- For documentation additions, write complete file at once to avoid edit conflicts
- Always run npm install first to ensure dependencies are available
- Quality gates: typecheck → lint → build
