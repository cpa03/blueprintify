# Knowledge Review

> **Document drift tracking** — records inconsistencies between documentation and actual codebase state after each merge cycle.

## Purpose

This file is referenced by the Knowledge Steward step in `.github/workflows/main.yml`. It tracks:

- Inconsistencies between docs and code
- Documentation gaps discovered during PR review
- Recommendations for bringing docs in sync with actual code

## Current State

**Last Review**: 2026-06-07 (RepoKeeper Cycle 67)
**Status**: ✅ Up to date — with noted exceptions

As of Cycle 67:

- All documentation aligns with current codebase state — with corrections noted below
- No drift detected between docs/ and apps/ code
- **CHANGELOG updated**: Added missing entries for PRs #1669 through #1673 including BugFixer ULW audit, RepoKeeper Cycle 66, slide-out animation, ENV_VAR_KEYS config, and BroCula Jun 7 audit report
- **No new missing README references found** — all 46 documentation files are properly referenced
- **CI workflow fixes still blocked**: workflow files on `main` still use `node-version: "20"` and stale `docs/bug.md`/`docs/feature.md` references. A maintainer with `workflows: write` permission must push the prepared fixes.
- **Shared tests grew by +8**: 203 → 211 (8 new tests since Cycle 66)

## Historical Drift Corrections

| Date       | Issue                                                                                                       | Resolution                                                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2026-05-31 | `main.yml` referenced `docs/bug.md` and `docs/feature.md` (renamed to `bugs.md`/`features.md`)              | Fixed in RepoKeeper Cycle 39 (branch only — blocked from push)                       |
| 2026-05-31 | CI workflows used `node-version: "20"` instead of `"22"`                                                    | Fixed in RepoKeeper Cycle 39 (branch only — blocked from push)                       |
| 2026-06-04 | Same drift regressed — CI workflows reverted to `node-version: "20"` and stale doc refs returned            | Fixed in RepoKeeper Cycle 51 (branch only — blocked from push)                       |
| 2026-06-05 | CI workflow fixes still NOT on `main` — re-applied on `chore/repokeeper-cycle-59` branch                    | Prepared in RepoKeeper Cycle 59; still blocked by `workflows: write` permission      |
| 2026-06-06 | `ci-configuration.md` falsely claimed workflow fixes were applied on `main`                                 | Corrected in RepoKeeper Cycle 61 — now accurately documents `main` state and blocker |
| 2026-06-06 | 6 empty CI fix commits attempted — Node.js 22 update + doc refs fix blocked by `workflows: write`           | Noted in RepoKeeper Cycle 63 — workflow files on `main` remain unchanged             |
| 2026-06-06 | `brocula-hunt-2026-06-06-run2.md` and `brocula-hunt-2026-06-06-run3.md` missing from README                 | Fixed in RepoKeeper Cycle 64 — added both to directory tree and docs links section   |
| 2026-06-07 | `docs/blueprint.md` claimed React 18 and "React hooks" state management                                     | Fixed in RepoKeeper Cycle 65 — updated to React 19 and Zustand                       |
| 2026-06-07 | `brocula-hunt-2026-06-06-run4.md` missing from README                                                       | Fixed in RepoKeeper Cycle 65 — added to directory tree and docs links section        |
| 2026-06-07 | `brocula-hunt-2026-06-07.md` missing from README; CHANGELOG stale (#1649-#1668 missing)                     | Fixed in RepoKeeper Cycle 66 — added BroCula Jun 7 ref, updated CHANGELOG            |
| 2026-06-07 | CHANGELOG stale (#1669-#1673 missing) — BugFixer, RepoKeeper 66, slide-out animation, ENV_VAR_KEYS, BroCula | Fixed in RepoKeeper Cycle 67 — added all 5 missing PR entries to CHANGELOG           |
